Clock design program notes:
-- Box2D for simulation
Use links for combined gears
Single shape, many bodies
Can use a edge as a shape -- but they don't collide with themselves. Will need to use compound shapes (teeth and innards)
b2_dynamicBody moves in response to forces (create body from definition, create and attach a polygon shape, (create a shape then create a fixture with the shape info)
iterate at 60 Hz, with at a min 8 velocity, 3 position iterations (double prefered for us)
Make sure all your edges are longer than b2_linearSlop (5mm).
bodyDef.allowSleep = true;
bodyDef.awake = true;


-- GLFW / GLEW with raw OpenGL for display 
-- IMGUI for rendering
-- (pretty much take the testbed for Box2D and merge it with my basic starting bed)
-- Keep object sizes from 0.1 to 10 meters (units) in length
